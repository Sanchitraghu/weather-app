## Important Note

This project uses the OpenWeather API, and the API credentials are stored in the `.env` file included in the repository.

⚠️ **Please note:** Including the `.env` file in version control is **not recommended** as a best practice due to security concerns. It is included here only for simplicity and demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, sensitive information should be excluded from Git using a `.gitignore` file and managed securely.
